# Hello~!

This window has opened because it was unable to access certain features
Make sure you have completed all the installation instructions below:

1. Give the app full disk permission (this allows us to query the iMessage database for new texts):
    Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access -> GPT Message Bot
2. Install the MacOS shortcut that allows us to automatically send messages. This can be found by selecting "Reveal Files" in the menubar drop down.
    a. Download send-imessage.shortcut and open it using Finder.
    b. Click the blue Add Shortcut button (you can use the 3-dot menu to inspect the steps executed if you desire).
    c. Install py-imessage-shortcuts using pip:

3. Once those are done, quit and re-rerun the app.
